# Hi there, I'm Ozzy. Dominguez 👋

## About Me 🚀

I’m a Civil Engineering student with a strong interest in Geotechnical Engineering, particularly in mining, tailings management, and energy-related infrastructure. My curiosity grew from observing how large-scale earthworks and foundations interact with complex terrain—especially in Colorado—and was solidified through geotechnical coursework and hands-on exposure.

Alongside my studies, I have experience in radiation safety and regulatory compliance, which reinforced the importance of risk management, safety culture, and environmental responsibility in engineering and energy-related industries. I’m especially interested in engineering work that blends field experience, technical analysis, and big-picture systems thinking to support resilient infrastructure and responsible resource development.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Geotechnical analysis methods, Unsaturated Soils, field investigation practices, and applied engineering software**
- 🔭 Exploring: **Mining engineering, tailings systems, and sustainable infrastructure**
- 🌍 Languages: **English & Spanish**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a big-picture thinker who likes asking *why* before *how*—especially when earth, structures, and people intersect.

## 💧 Water Quality Visualizer

An interactive browser-based tool for exploring water quality CSV data through charts and statistics.

![Water Quality Visualizer Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38372145-4d18-426e-aa04-cc089313823b)

### Features
- **CSV Upload** – drag-and-drop or file picker; works with any water quality CSV
- **Four chart types** – Line, Bar, Area, and Scatter plots powered by Chart.js
- **Multi-parameter display** – toggle individual parameters (pH, DO, turbidity, etc.) on/off
- **Group / Color By** – split series by location, site, or any text column
- **Dataset Overview** – row/column counts and per-parameter averages with units
- **Water Quality Index** – per-site composite score (0–100) based on EPA-recognised thresholds
- **Data Table** – scrollable view of all raw readings
- **Sample dataset** – 12-month, 3-site dataset included for instant demo

### Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (or serve the folder with a local HTTP server).
2. Click **▶ Load Sample Dataset** to explore the built-in demo data, **or** drag a CSV file onto the upload area.
3. Use the chart type tabs, X-Axis selector, Group/Color By dropdown, and parameter checkboxes to customise the view.
4. Click **🔄 Update Chart** to re-render after changing options.

### CSV Format
Any CSV with a header row works. Recognised water quality columns get automatic unit labels and WQI scoring:

| Column name | Parameter | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `pH` | Acidity/alkalinity | — |
| `Dissolved_Oxygen_mg_L` | Dissolved oxygen | mg/L |
| `Temperature_C` | Water temperature | °C |
| `Turbidity_NTU` | Turbidity | NTU |
| `Conductivity_uS_cm` | Electrical conductivity | µS/cm |
| `Nitrate_mg_L` | Nitrate | mg/L |
| `Phosphate_mg_L` | Phosphate | mg/L |
| `Coliform_CFU_100mL` | Fecal coliform | CFU/100 mL |

Columns with other names are still charted — they just won't appear in the WQI table.

### Libraries used (vendored, no build step required)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) v4.4.3 — canvas-based charting
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) v5.4.1 — fast, robust CSV parser

### What You’ll See Here 📘
This GitHub serves as a space to:
primarily document coursework and exploration from my AI-focused engineering class, where I’m learning how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be applied to environmental and infrastructure-related challenges. Content may include small analyses, modeling exercises, and experiments focused on topics like water quality, infrastructure optimization, and climate-related decision-making, viewed through a civil and geotechnical engineering lens.

More to come as I continue learning and gaining experience.
