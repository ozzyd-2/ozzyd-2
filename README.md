# Hi there, I'm Ozzy. Dominguez 👋

## About Me 🚀

I’m a Civil Engineering student with a strong interest in Geotechnical Engineering, particularly in mining, tailings management, and energy-related infrastructure. My curiosity grew from observing how large-scale earthworks and foundations interact with complex terrain—especially in Colorado—and was solidified through geotechnical coursework and hands-on exposure.

Alongside my studies, I have experience in radiation safety and regulatory compliance, which reinforced the importance of risk management, safety culture, and environmental responsibility in engineering and energy-related industries. I’m especially interested in engineering work that blends field experience, technical analysis, and big-picture systems thinking to support resilient infrastructure and responsible resource development.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Geotechnical analysis methods, Unsaturated Soils, field investigation practices, and applied engineering software**
- 🔭 Exploring: **Mining engineering, tailings systems, and sustainable infrastructure**
- 🌍 Languages: **English & Spanish**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a big-picture thinker who likes asking *why* before *how*—especially when earth, structures, and people intersect.

### What You’ll See Here 📘
This GitHub serves as a space to:
primarily document coursework and exploration from my AI-focused engineering class, where I’m learning how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be applied to environmental and infrastructure-related challenges. Content may include small analyses, modeling exercises, and experiments focused on topics like water quality, infrastructure optimization, and climate-related decision-making, viewed through a civil and geotechnical engineering lens.

More to come as I continue learning and gaining experience.
